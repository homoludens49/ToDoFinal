assignment

 <!-- Dear Reviewer,

 Hope this readme finds you well. 
 I want to be as transparent as possible.
 My job application initially was designed to fit backend Node.js developer position, but to ensure that Ubiquiti inc have received it , i also applied to Junior Fullstack position.  
 Anyhow, i was so happy to receive the assignment, so i took it as a challenge.
 This assignment came right before my family trip so technically i had only 3 days to learn TypeScript and Socket.io, in order to meet the assignments requirements.

 Taking this in to account, i hope you will enjoy reviewing my code, and any feedback would be highly appreciated.

 Best regards, 
 Pjotrs -->
